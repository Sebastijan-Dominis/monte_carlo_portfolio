# üíπ Monte Carlo Portfolio üíπ

## üöÄ Overview

This web application allows users to run the Monte Carlo simulation on a portfolio of choice. They can choose which stocks, ETFs, and/or cryptocurrencies to include by adding their respective tickers, which can be found on Yahoo finance. Users also determine the distribution of money within a given portfolio, as well as the amount of money itself. Registered users can save settings for running the Monte Carlo simulation, so that they don't have to re-enter them each time they want to run the simulation again. This application is aimed towards anyone thinking about, or having invested money into stocks, ETFs, and/or cryptocurrencies. It helps these individuals estimate how they can expect their portfolio to change over the next 100 days, based on the past 1000 days. While predicting the markets is ultimately impossible, tools like this can aid investors in deciding what to do with their money.

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:**
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Render
  - DB: Render PostgreSQL

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3.12+
- Docker (optional)
- sqlite (installed with requirements) or PostgreSQL (local or Docker)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sebastijan-Dominis/monte_carlo_portfolio.git
cd monte_carlo_portfolio
```

### 2. Set up backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- define .env variables, as described in .env.example
- optionally:

```bash
docker build -t your-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 your-backend
```

### 3. Set up frontend

```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```

- define .env variables, as described in .env.example

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

### backend

SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-jwt
ALGORITHM=algorithm-of-your-choice-for-jwt

option 1:
DB_URL=sqlite:///./mydb
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=DEV

option 2:
DB_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydb
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION

API_URL=url-to-frontend

- going with the sqlite option will automatically create an sqlite database within your backend folder
- if opting for postgresql, make sure to create an actual database locally or remotely, run it, and use a valid url to connect to it (should be defined in the DB_URL environment variable)
- using sqlite is recommended for development and local use (easy to use), while postgresql is recommended for deployment

### frontend

VITE_API_URL=url-to-backend
VITE_API_PORT=8000  
VITE_PORT=5173

## Deployment

Database (Render PostgreSQL)

- Hosted PostgreSQL instance

Backend (Render)

- Dockerized (optional) FastAPI deployed on Render
- Add environment variables via Render dashboard
- Use the appropriate url from database deployment to connect backend to the database by setting the DB_URL environment variable to that value
- General health check route: /
- Health check route to check the connection to the database: /health

Frontend (Vercel)

- Deployed to Vercel from GitHub repository
- Set environment variables - most importantly, set VITE_API_URL to the appropriate value that connects frontend to the backend on Render

- In Backend on Render, change the API_URL variable to enable connection to the frontend

## Database Schema

- if one chooses to manually create the PostgreSQL database, it should be done like so:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

CREATE TABLE users (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS portfolio_settings;

CREATE TABLE portfolio_settings (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
tickers JSONB NOT NULL,
distribution_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (distribution_type IN ('random', 'equal', 'exact')),
distribution JSONB NOT NULL,
initial_portfolio DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
owner_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
);
